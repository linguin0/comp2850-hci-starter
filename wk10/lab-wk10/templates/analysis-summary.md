### Task-by-Task Interpretation

- **T1 Filter**: _What does the data show? Who is excluded?_
- **T2 Edit**: _What barriers did pilots encounter? Reference quotes/notes._
- **T3 Add**: _Any anomalies (e.g. long tail, high MAD)?_
- **T4 Delete**: _Confirm parity across variants._

## Priority Findings

| ID | Issue | Task | Evidence (metrics + notes) | WCAG | Impact | Inclusion | Effort | Priority |
|----|-------|------|-----------------------------|------|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| wk9-01 |  |  | `analysis/analysis.csv#` ; `pilot-notes/P1.md` |  |  |  |  |  |

## Data Quality Notes

- [ ] All metrics logged (no missing sessions)
- [ ] JS-off samples noted if n < 2 (document follow-up pilots)
- [ ] Any anomalies explained below:
  - _Example_: P4 experienced network delay; excluded from time calculation.
